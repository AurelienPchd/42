Welcome to My GitHub Repository
Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Aur√©lien, and I am currently a student at 42 Paris, where I am honing my skills in computer science and software development.

About This Repository
This repository is a comprehensive collection of all the projects I have completed during my studies at 42 Paris. Here, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my proficiency in various programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies.

Projects
1. [Libft]
Description: The Libft project is a fundamental part of the 42 curriculum. It involves creating a library of basic C functions that replicate the functionality of several standard library functions. The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of these functions by implementing them ourselves, thereby enhancing our proficiency in C programming.

Technologies Used: C, Makefile

2. [ft_printf]

Description: The ft_printf project involves creating our own version of the printf function from the C standard library. This project enhances our understanding of variadic functions and complex formatting in C.

Technologies Used: C, Makefile

3. [get_next_line]

Description: The get_next_line project involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor until a newline character is encountered. This project helps in mastering file I/O and buffer management in C.

Technologies Used: C, Makefile

4. [so_long]

Description: The so_long project is about creating a small 2D game where the player moves around a map to collect items and reach an exit. This project introduces basic game development concepts and graphics programming using the MinilibX library.

Technologies Used: C, MinilibX, Makefile

5. [push_swap]

Description: The push_swap project involves creating a program to sort data on a stack with a limited set of instructions and the least amount of moves possible. This project focuses on algorithmic thinking and optimization.

Technologies Used: C, Makefile

6. [pipex]

Description: The pipex project involves reproducing the behavior of the shell pipeline, handling pipes, and redirecting input/output. This project deepens the understanding of process creation and inter-process communication in Unix.

Technologies Used: C, Unix system calls, Makefile

...and many more!
